Link to the website:

Just run index.html

# Example1
Setup an AngularJS app from scratch

* Create an app (angular.module)
* Create a controller (app.controller)
* Use the app and controller in a view (ng-app)
* Add model and display data in view (ng-controller, ng-repeat, $scope, $scope.model {{model}})
* Add behaviour to the view (ng-click)

# Example2
Directives

* Create directive (app.directive, new HTML element)
* Add behaviour to directive by linking

TODO: Read more about directives. What is link? *sarcastic*
